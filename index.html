    <p>Hey Everyone! I'm the head lifeguard at Rinconada Pool in Palo Alto. 
       There is a lot that I would like to do and it starts with doing well in this bootcamp. 
       I was born in Redwood City and have lived all over the pennisula/south bay. 
       That being said I feel most at home in East Palo Alto. I have lived in EPA for the last 10 years! 
       I play underwater hockey and I really enjoy playing magic the gathering! 
       If you want to anymore of those please feel free to ask me!
       I am set on learning about how to be a great web developer. 
       Once I tackle that I am going to learn about digital marketing startin with SEM and SEO. 
       The idea is to be able to provide both services to anyone that would need it.
       I get excited when I think about creating a unique web experience. 
       Right not I limited in my knowledge but I can't wait to see what I am able to create once I learn more!
    </p>
